# User & Security Management

Linux is a **multi-user operating system**, meaning multiple users can access the system simultaneously.  
Security in Linux is enforced through **users, groups, ownership, and permissions**, ensuring controlled and secure access to system resources.

## 1.1 Creating Users and Granting Sudo Access

### Concept

- The **root user** has unrestricted access to the system and can perform any operation.
- Direct root usage is risky because accidental commands can damage the system.
- `sudo` (Superuser Do) provides **controlled privilege escalation**, allowing trusted users to execute administrative commands safely.
- Linux follows the **principle of least privilege**, where users are given only the permissions they need.
- Using `sudo` also improves **auditing**, as administrative actions are logged per user.

### Commands

```bash
sudo adduser username
sudo usermod -aG sudo username



## 1.2 File Ownership (chown)


Concept

Every file has:

Owner

Group

Others

Commands
sudo chown user filename
sudo chown :group filename
sudo chown user:group filename

1.3 File Permissions (chmod)
Permission Values
Permission	Value
Read (r)	4
Write (w)	2
Execute (x)	1
Octal Mode (Most Common)
chmod 755 file


Meaning:

Owner → rwx

Group → r-x

Others → r-x

Key Concept

Execute permission on a directory allows entering it

1.4 Can Two Users Have Different Permissions on the Same File?
Answer

Yes.

Linux controls access using:

Ownership

Group membership

Permission bits

This allows different users to interact with the same file differently.
